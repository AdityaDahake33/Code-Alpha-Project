# code-alpha-project
This repository contains the Cyber Security Internship at CodeAlpha. Each task helped me build hands-on skills in network security, ethical hacking, and Python-based security tools.

âœ… Task 1 â€“ Basic Network Packet Sniffer
Developed a simple packet sniffer using Python & Scapy to capture real-time network traffic. Extracted key details like source/destination IPs, protocols, and packet lengths. Gained practical insight into how data flows across networks.
