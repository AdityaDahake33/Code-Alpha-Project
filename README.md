This repository contains Task 1 of my Cyber Security Internship at CodeAlpha.
In this project, I developed a Basic Network Packet Sniffer using Python and Scapy to capture and analyze real-time network traffic.
As a Cyber Security student, this task helped me understand the fundamentals of packet sniffing, protocol analysis, and hands-on network monitoring.

👨‍💻 Languages: Python | 🛠 Tools: Scapy
💡 Skills: Packet Inspection, Network Protocols, Traffic Analysis
